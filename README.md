Users
⮚  	Manager
The manager will have access to all data of the application, including financial statements, employees management(accounts, salaries based on clock in/out), management of suppliers and inventory, access to all the bills. The managers interface will allow him to open and edit the accounts of all the employees he want to add or remove from his business with their names and id’s and provide them with their certain payment for each category of employees he has based on the hours they work which will be calculated from when they check in and out when they open their accounts. It will allow him to add suppliers he wants for different products the restaurant will provide with the respective prices he can get from them. This will allow the manager to add the items he wants in its inventory and also provide the price he will sell this items for in his restaurant. A benefit to this is that the software will calculate by itself the profits the company will have from deducting the buying price from suppliers to the price the restaurant sells the products. He will also have access to all the bills to provide him the opportunity to see how much work he has during the day or the week or the month, or also see the progress of the servers he has to see which of them will bring him the most profit so he can implement any policy to reward the one who has worked harder.

⮚  	Servers
The servers can daily deduct the inventory by selling good each time they print a recipe. Each recipe will be assigned to a certain table that the server will choose. When there are less then needed items in inventory an alert will be sent to the manager so he can order goods to the suppliers to replace the goods sold. He may even choose to automate the requests sent to the suppliers when the inventory reaches a certain level. Each server will have to clock in when they arrive to work and clock out when they leave the work , this way their wage will be calculated.

⮚  	Bar tender
The Bar tender will receive the receipt sent out by the server concerning to drinks and snacks. He will be able to see them so that he can prepare the orders in the order they are sent and alert the server when the order is ready

The software will also have the ability to create some basic financial statements like income statements and the cash flow.
