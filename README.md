The purpose of this software application is to automate some crucial services of restaurants into one application. The software will be used by almost all the actors operating a restaurant, from the owner, manager to employees. 

The current system that the restaurant uses is desktop system for daily operations, although, the desktop system is not-up-to date enough to cover the existing needs. The restaurants uses software programs such as MS-Excel for recording the employee data, that is when new employee is hired, his/ her information have to be filled in the computerized work contract form that contains personal details of employee including age, name, sex, date, address etc.

We are suggesting a software system that would remove all the above problems. Our Restaurant Automation system is focused on making the restaurant fully automated, in order to facilitate the coordination of different work activities. The employees in the moment that start work will make check in in the system and check out when they left work. This is done to calculate their wage depending on the working hours. Each employee would have its profile in the system, which is managed by the manager. Manager can create and modify profiles, can view the amount of money that each worker has done daily. Also, the system keep data about the suppliers and products that they offer.
